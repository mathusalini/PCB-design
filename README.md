## 🔷 Why PCB?

A **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)** is used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components using copper tracks printed on an insulating substrate.

### Importance of PCB:
- Provides **permanent and reliable connections**
- Reduces **short circuits and wiring errors**
- Makes the circuit **compact and neat**
- Improves **signal quality and noise performance**
- Suitable for **mass production**
- Enhances **safety and durability**
- Gives a **professional appearance** to electronic products

In real-world applications, **almost all electronic products use PCBs**.

## 🔷 Why PCB is Required in Electronic Projects?

PCB is especially important in projects such as **power supplies, audio circuits, and IoT systems** because:
- High voltage and high frequency signals need **controlled routing**
- Proper spacing between components is required
- Heat dissipation must be managed efficiently
- Ensures **consistent and repeatable performance**
- Improves **user safety**

Example:  
In a **transformerless power supply**, PCB layout is critical to maintain **clearance and isolation** between high-voltage and low-voltage sections.

## 🔷 What PCB Designers Must Consider?

### 1️⃣ Electrical Considerations
- Track width based on current rating
- Proper grounding techniques
- Noise and electromagnetic interference (EMI) control
- Short and optimized signal paths

### 2️⃣ Safety Considerations
- Clearance and creepage distances
- Isolation between AC mains and low-voltage sections
- Proper placement of fuses and protection components

### 3️⃣ Component Placement
- Logical signal flow (Input → Processing → Output)
- Heat-generating components placed away from sensitive parts
- Easy access for soldering and maintenance

### 4️⃣ Mechanical Considerations
- PCB size and shape
- Mounting holes and connector placement
- Enclosure compatibility

### 5️⃣ Manufacturing Considerations
- Use of standard footprints
- Avoid very thin tracks and small vias
- Proper silkscreen labeling
- Design Rule Check (DRC) compliance

## 🔷 PCB Design Tools (EDA Tools)

PCB design is carried out using **EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools**.

### Commonly Used PCB Design Software:
- Altium Designer
- OrCAD
- Eagle
- EasyEDA
- **KiCad**

---
